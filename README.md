REFLECTIONS:
Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
I think I've achieved all the base requirements - I would have liked to make the console messages appear in the window, or even a browser message but I did not get round to that.
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
