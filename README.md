An idle game, cookie clicker-esque

REFLECTIONS:
Required
ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I think I've achieved all the base requirements - I would have liked to make the console messages appear in the window, or even a browser message but I did not get round to that.
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
The stretch goal for deployment seems like it might be simple enough, but when I think about what that means without looking into it, I am baffled as to what deployment instructions might look like for this
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
The || operator took a bit of getting used to, but as a "does this exist? if not, 0". The javascript, and writing it, I'm pretty pleased with. Things are making a lot more sense than they did, but syntax takes a long time.

CSS is still a bit of a nightmare, and the scattergun approach holds true, but after spending entirely too long placing shop-container as a grid, I remembered about absolute positioning. I wanted to make the cookie and cps bold, but couldn't do it in 30s so gave up.
